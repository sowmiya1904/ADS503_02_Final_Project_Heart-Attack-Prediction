# Predictive Healthcare: The Role of Machine Learning in Heart Attack Prevention

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using patient medical data. Early detection through such predictive models can significantly improve preventive care and patient outcomes.

## Project Description
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, necessitating effective early detection methods. This project leverages the Cleveland heart disease dataset to train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to identify the most accurate and reliable predictor of heart disease. The study involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model validation to ensure robust and generalizable results.
